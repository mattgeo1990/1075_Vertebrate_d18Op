```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

## Let's think about exactly what you want to ask about how the V1075 data compares to other datasets.

First, maybe look to see if 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Compare to other datasets -----------------------------------------------


# taxon plots
    # Bateun el Hmaima, Early Albian, Africa (Amiot, 2006)
      ggplot(bateun, aes(x=d18O, y=eco_type)) + 
        geom_point() +
        ggtitle("Bateun el Hmaima, Early Albian, Africa (Amiot, 2006)")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
